# odin-recipes
A very simple recipe website

This website will consist of a main index page that will link to a few recipes.

During the process I will make good use of git workflow, including best pratices when commiting.

I will revisit this project in the future and style it with CSS.

This will serve me as an exercise for practicing the foundation of HTML and GIT/GITHUB knowledge.
